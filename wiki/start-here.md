# Start here

## Purpose
The purpose of this wiki is to be the entire operational brain for this project.

## What this is
A git-native LLM Wiki owned by **\<your-org>\** (set `org` in [wiki/lisa-wiki.config.json](lisa-wiki.config.json) after templating) and maintained by the `lisa-wiki` kernel. It is the durable home for this project's knowledge (and documentation). Raw sources are preserved under `wiki/sources/`; distilled knowledge lives in the category pages; the rules are in `wiki/schema/llm-wiki-contract.md`.

## How to use it
- **New here?** Run `/onboard-me` (Codex: `$lisa-wiki-onboard-me`) for a guided tour + sample questions.
- **Find/answer something:** `/query "<question>"` - cited answers from the wiki.
- **Add knowledge:** `/ingest <url|file|prompt>` (Codex: `$lisa-wiki-ingest`), or `/ingest` with no argument for a full ingest across all enabled non-external-write sources (external-write sources require explicit intent).
- **Browse:** [index.md](index.md).
- **Check health:** `/lint`.

## Map
Synthesis categories: concepts, entities, decisions, architecture, requirements, playbooks, open-questions, projects.
Sources: `wiki/sources/` - State: `wiki/state/` - Contract: `wiki/schema/llm-wiki-contract.md` - Log: `wiki/log.md`.
